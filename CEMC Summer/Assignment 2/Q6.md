Because there are at least three distinct integer in the list, the maximum and the minimum should have a difference of at least 2. Therefore, the difference of the largest k+1 terms and the smallest k+1 terms is at least two.

That means: $2\le (k+1)|m_1-m_2|<{k+1\over 2025}$.

Therefore, $k+1>4050$.

Because $k$ is an integer, $k\ge 4050$, which means there won't be a solution for $k<4050$.

When $k=4050$, we can construct a sequence that satisfies:

The sequence contains a 6, 8099 7s, and an 8.

Check: $m_1={6+7*4050\over 4051}=7-{1\over 4051}$, $m_2={8+7*4050\over 4051}=7+{1\over 4051}$

$|m_1-m_2|={2\over 4051}<{1\over 2025}$

Therefore, the smallest $k$ that satisfies is 4050.
