Because $a_n$ is an arithmetic sequence, and $d$ is the common difference:

$a_n=a_1+(n-1)d=1+(n-1)d$

Therefore, $a_6=1+5d, a_{14}=1+13d, a_{34}=1+33d$

Because this three number form a geometric sequence:

$a_{14}^2=a_6\times a_{34}$

Therefore, $(1+13d)^2=(1+5d)(1+33d)$

$169d^2+26d+1=165d^2+38d+1$

$4d^2=12d$

$d=0\ or\ d=3$â€‹

Because $d>0$, $d=3$.

Therefore, $a_{2025}=1+2024d=6073$
